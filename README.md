- functional components and class components 
- we will create class components as they are more powerfull 
- exapmle if we want to use Home component we will do <Home />
- Class components , we can use contructors , statefull because we have inputs or forms 

- Functional Component , we have no classes but only functions we can use things in much simpleer ways like onClick , we write very less code and we do not have to bind and text cases are easy to write, we call the stateless components
